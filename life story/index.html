            <h2>Childhood history</h2>
            <p>One transformative childhood experience that significantly shaped my personality occurred when I was 10 years old during a summer retreat with my family at a secluded cabin in the woods. With no Wi-Fi or television, our days were filled with exploring nature, building a treehouse as a family, and enjoying evenings around a campfire, sharing stories and toasting marshmallows. The absence of modern technology emphasized the importance of genuine human connection, fostering strong family bonds. Cooking together, stargazing, and engaging in board games created lasting memories and instilled in me a love for nature, resilience in the face of challenges, and an appreciation for shared moments that would influence my values in the years to come.</p>
